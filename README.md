## DAL

DAL is an acronym that I made up. This stands for `Directionless Active Learning` and it means that I am actively learning but in a `directionless` manner. This is a cop out because I don't need to go through formal training courses. Which can take a long time and is not very practical for me working in tech where I come across quite a lot of technologies over a given week. So with DALs I jot down an unfamiliar term or a phrase that might pop up over during the day and then later on
look into that a little bit. At the very least, take some notes on that. I may write a prioritisation algorithm to show me the next thing to pick up but at the moment, it really is pick something off the list that looks interesting and useful and learn about it a little bit.
