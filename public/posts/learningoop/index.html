<p>I first learnt about Object Oriented Programming in a musty dark lecture room where I learnt about concepts like abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance in relation to C++.</p>
<p>This was more than 10 years ago, and I had barely touched C++ or OOP since then. Not only that but I doubt I understand C++ outside of a few <code>cout</code> statements.</p>
<p>But now I need to know C# for my work. The advantages of things this time are that I&rsquo;ve worked with typed languages such as Typescript in the role of a front-end developer and briefly looked into class base components for React (before they moved to functional components).</p>
<p>Looking at the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/">C# Beginner tutorial</a>. It looks like C# is the language (no sh*t sherlock!) and that .NET is the engine that actually runs the code. Sort of how like NodeJS with its V8 engine runs Javascript. I am sure that these are vastly different technologies but in the scope of this document, we can say that are roughly equivalent.</p>
<p>So where do I eventually want to go with learning OOP? I suppose that my &rsquo;lofty&rsquo; goal is to be able to start developing with an OOP language such as C# or C++ or even Go or Rust (provided that the latter two are OOP) to do some &lsquo;real&rsquo; programming. The monetary reason is that C# jobs are a dime in a dozen. Being able to abstract away details in Classes/Objects and define interfaces/types with well written extensions and implementations are a powerful tool to have. There are a lot of words in the last sentence that I cannot quite correctly define without researching.</p>
