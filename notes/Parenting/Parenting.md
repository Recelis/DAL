# Parenting

When you have children, you will be reminded of how you were treated as a kid. This triggering can resurface as irrational irritability and so you may act in ways that reflect how you were treated as a child. One example is if your parents withdrew away from you, you may still feel a lot of hurt about this as a parent and withdraw from your own children.

## Rupture and Repair

A rupture is a type of hurt you feel as a child. Repairing this hurt will require a lot of effort.

"If you feel like you need to take a break every hour of every day, what you probably need os a break from feelings they trigger in you."

To self repair, look back your child hood with compassion.

### Inner Critic

How we talk to ourselves is something else that gets passed down.

1. Recognise the voice
2. Don't engage or argue with it. Treat as an awkward voice.
3. Do it regardless.
4. Be aware of passing it down to your child.

## Environment

It isn't about the family structure, it is about how we get along with each other.

### Arguing

Important to know how you feel about the context and to share that. It is also important to know how the other is feeling. If you leave feelings out of it, you will only be playing `fact tennis` which is when you just give more and more reasons until the other stops giving reasons or you run out of reasons. No one feels good at the end of this.

`Distractions` or avoidance are another unhelpful way to deal with arguments. It also means that intimacy is avoided too.

The next is `being a martyr` to make everyone guilty, but then they become resentful

Conflict puts kids into a stress mode instead of treating home as a place for security.

### Ideal way to argue

Start with how you feel.
"I feel fed up when I come home after having washed up in the morning to see more of the dishes left to do."

Good to use `I statements` instead of `you statements`.

The goal is to understand instead of winning and this does not mean the other person will change for you, but you will develop a more emotionally intelligent and respectful way of arguing.
