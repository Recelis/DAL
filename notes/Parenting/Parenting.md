# Parenting

When you have children, you will be reminded of how you were treated as a kid. This triggering can resurface as irrational irritability and so you may act in ways that reflect how you were treated as a child. One example is if your parents withdrew away from you, you may still feel a lot of hurt about this as a parent and withdraw from your own children.

## Rupture and Repair

A rupture is a type of hurt you feel as a child. Repairing this hurt will require a lot of effort.

"If you feel like you need to take a break every hour of every day, what you probably need os a break from feelings they trigger in you."

To self repair, look back your child hood with compassion.

### Inner Critic

How we talk to ourselves is something else that gets passed down.

1. Recognise the voice
2. Don't engage or argue with it. Treat as an awkward voice.
3. Do it regardless.
4. Be aware of passing it down to your child.
