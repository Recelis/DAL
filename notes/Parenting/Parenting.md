# Parenting

When you have children, you will be reminded of how you were treated as a kid. This triggering can resurface as irrational irritability and so you may act in ways that reflect how you were treated as a child. One example is if your parents withdrew away from you, you may still feel a lot of hurt about this as a parent and withdraw from your own children.

## Rupture and Repair

A rupture is a type of hurt you feel as a child. Repairing this hurt will require a lot of effort.

"If you feel like you need to take a break every hour of every day, what you probably need os a break from feelings they trigger in you."

To self repair, look back your child hood with compassion.

### Inner Critic

How we talk to ourselves is something else that gets passed down.

1. Recognise the voice
2. Don't engage or argue with it. Treat as an awkward voice.
3. Do it regardless.
4. Be aware of passing it down to your child.

## Environment

It isn't about the family structure, it is about how we get along with each other.

### Arguing

Important to know how you feel about the context and to share that. It is also important to know how the other is feeling. If you leave feelings out of it, you will only be playing `fact tennis` which is when you just give more and more reasons until the other stops giving reasons or you run out of reasons. No one feels good at the end of this.

`Distractions` or avoidance are another unhelpful way to deal with arguments. It also means that intimacy is avoided too.

The next is `being a martyr` to make everyone guilty, but then they become resentful

Conflict puts kids into a stress mode instead of treating home as a place for security.

### Ideal way to argue

Start with how you feel.
"I feel fed up when I come home after having washed up in the morning to see more of the dishes left to do."

Good to use `I statements` instead of `you statements`.

The goal is to understand instead of winning and this does not mean the other person will change for you, but you will develop a more emotionally intelligent and respectful way of arguing.

### Fostering Goodwill

Two ways of fostering goodwill.

- responding to bids for connection or attention
- finding solace in each other instead of treating each other as adversaries

Couples who are stressed by each other tend to be split up or in a dysfunctional relationship after a while. While couples who are soothed by each other will stick together.

## Feelings

Your job as a parent is to `contain` your child's feelings. Ignoring or denying the child's feelings is harmful to mental health. Scolding, belittling, advising or distracting can try to help them feel better, or ourselves, but when feelings are disallowed, they don't disappear.

<blockquote>
The common cause of adult depression is not what's happening to the adult in the present but because, as a child, they did not learn in their relationship with their parents how they can be soothed.
</blockquote>

Their capacity for them diminishes if left alone.

The three main ways of dealing with emotion are:

### Repressing

This is when you push the strong feelings away and say: "shush". You dismiss your child's feelings as unimportant.

### Overreacting

This is when you become as hysterical as they are and cry with them.

### Containing

Acknowledge and validate all of your feelings for yourself and your child. This is something that psychotherapists do for their clients.

<blockquote>Stick with the philosophy.instead of soothing the tears, feeling with rather than dealing with. If you take a child's feelings seriously and sooth them when they need it, they will gradually learn to internalize that soothing and eventually become able to do it for themselves.</blockquote>

May need to practise yourself and deal with them. One way is by defining your feeling rather than yourself. Instead of "you are sad", say "you feel sad" or it "looks like you are feeling sad".

Don't dismiss feelings. One example is when kids say that monsters are under the bed. Instead of saying, "monsters don't exist", you can ask about what the names of the monster are. What they look like. Don't dismiss them.

#### Accepting Every Mood

It is not possible to be happy all the time. If you tell your children to be happy when they say they are "not happy". Scold them or argue that they should be happy or even give them advice, they will not be happy. They will grow to be confused and unsure of their own feelings. Also, you are not validating or connecting to them.

Asking why they feel like that is enquiring about them.

Emotions do not have a fading control, you can't turn down one and keep the other. It only has a master volume. You can turn down all at a time. So turning down negative means turning down all.

#### Distracting away from feelings

Distraction is a trick used by parents to help their children avoid difficult feelings. It is detrimental to good mental health because they learn to need to be distracted whenever they have difficult feelings and don't learn how to work through difficult problems. Being firm, honest and accepting of their feelings:

"You don't like it when mum goes to work and leaves you at home, but she will be back home at the end of the day." is better than distracting away by giving them a toy. It is also not what we do as adults when we have a difficult thing. It takes time even for us to be able to be distracted away.

Of course, you can use distraction but only in relation to the difficult thing, i.e. telling your kid to focus on the sensation of your hand instead of the needle is powerful because it helps train your kids to switch focus during a difficult time.

## Pregnancy and Laying a Foundation

Think of your kid in the long term, the relationship you want to have with them and not just a chore for now.
Can be difficult to have a good relationship with them if you haven't built a good foundation with them using the frameworks and ideas from the previous sections.

Typically hard, because from the start of pregnancy there are a lot of rules which forces you to not think of your children as real people and you want to optimise them.

There is an idea of `sympathetic magic`, the idea if you do the perfect thing you can have a perfect child (but a perfect child is not accepting who they are), or avoiding potential issues like if you eat chocolate in pregnancy your kid will likely be happier. But crap still happens, or your kid is happy even though you didn't eat chocolate, and you may not have seen the advice until too late.

### Parent Tribe

Parents can fall into two categories. Facilitators and Regulators. Facilitators are those who are more like supply-side to the child. If the child wants or needs something they will provide. While Regulators want to provide a safe secure and predictable environment to their children. People have a tendency to be one or the other, but sometimes will switch. There is no right or wrong answer.

### Attachment Theory

The book goes through the story of a pair of twins where one had a tough birth and didn't see the mother until 4 weeks after birth. And then the mother distracted herself from looking after the child, leaving the child to start become clingy and made him unlikeable even by his twin. She saw this rupture in the child and started spending one on one time with him when he was 4 years old. So he started to become less clingy which would help avoid him having one sided relationships in the future.

Babies are born preprogrammed to develop attachment styles to work with their environment based on whether their needs are met.

### Secure Attachment Style

Needs are met. Generally trusting of people. Thinking you are okay and that others are as well. Optimistic.

### Insecure/Ambivalent Attachment Style

Only inconsistently met. Need to scream loud and hard to get attention and still sometimes don't get it. Belief that you will be overlooked and ignored. Don't think you are an okay person and don't believe others will be the same.

### Avoidant Attachment Style

Needs almost never met no matter how much you cried.Internal belief is that won't get attention no matter how hard you try. Don't believe you will have influence over others nor can be understood. Don't really let anyone get close to you.

### Dismissive Attachment Style

Instead of seeing to your needs, people expected you to meet theirs or they abused you, didn't give you anything, or caused physical harm. See others as a source of harm. No empathy.

## Good Mental Health

Building good mental health means forming a strong bond between parent and child. To do this, we start by learning about the give and take turn-taking of communication. Where we talk, observe and listen to our children instead of interrupting. Parents who are constantly on their phones may detract from their children's mental health because the number one priority is on their phone. It can be hard to do this as a parent, this is called `diaphobia`, but we do need to work through it.

Bad behaviour from our children will need to be treated with `love bombing` where we give ourselves fully to our kids. This is because they are calling out for attention and may have felt unseen, uncared for. People may say this is rewarding bad behaviour but it is treating the issue rather than masking the symptoms.

The book talks about sleep training and how it excacerbates the issue where kids feel unheard and their needs unmet. And instead suggests `sleep nudging` where we figure out our baseline and then try a little bit more if they are okay with it.

Lastly, it talks about play and how it is actually very effortful and work to imagine and figure things out instead of being a waste of time.
