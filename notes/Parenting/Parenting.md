# Parenting

When you have children, you will be reminded of how you were treated as a kid. This triggering can resurface as irrational irritability and so you may act in ways that reflect how you were treated as a child. One example is if your parents withdrew away from you, you may still feel a lot of hurt about this as a parent and withdraw from your own children.

## Rupture and Repair

A rupture is a type of hurt you feel as a child. Repairing this hurt will require a lot of effort.

"If you feel like you need to take a break every hour of every day, what you probably need os a break from feelings they trigger in you."

To self repair, look back your child hood with compassion.

### Inner Critic

How we talk to ourselves is something else that gets passed down.

1. Recognise the voice
2. Don't engage or argue with it. Treat as an awkward voice.
3. Do it regardless.
4. Be aware of passing it down to your child.

## Environment

It isn't about the family structure, it is about how we get along with each other.

### Arguing

Important to know how you feel about the context and to share that. It is also important to know how the other is feeling. If you leave feelings out of it, you will only be playing `fact tennis` which is when you just give more and more reasons until the other stops giving reasons or you run out of reasons. No one feels good at the end of this.

`Distractions` or avoidance are another unhelpful way to deal with arguments. It also means that intimacy is avoided too.

The next is `being a martyr` to make everyone guilty, but then they become resentful

Conflict puts kids into a stress mode instead of treating home as a place for security.

### Ideal way to argue

Start with how you feel.
"I feel fed up when I come home after having washed up in the morning to see more of the dishes left to do."

Good to use `I statements` instead of `you statements`.

The goal is to understand instead of winning and this does not mean the other person will change for you, but you will develop a more emotionally intelligent and respectful way of arguing.

### Fostering Goodwill

Two ways of fostering goodwill.

- responding to bids for connection or attention
- finding solace in each other instead of treating each other as adversaries

Couples who are stressed by each other tend to be split up or in a dysfunctional relationship after a while. While couples who are soothed by each other will stick together.

## Feelings

Your job as a parent is to `contain` your child's feelings. Ignoring or denying the child's feelings is harmful to mental health. Scolding, belittling, advising or distracting can try to help them feel better, or ourselves, but when feelings are disallowed, they don't disappear.

<blockquote>
The common cause of adult depression is not what's happening to the adult in the present but because, as a child, they did not learn in their relationship with their parents how they can be soothed.
</blockquote>

Their capacity for them diminishes if left alone.

The three main ways of dealing with emotion are:

### Repressing

This is when you push the strong feelings away and say: "shush". You dismiss your child's feelings as unimportant.

### Overreacting

This is when you become as hysterical as they are and cry with them.

### Containing

Acknowledge and validate all of your feelings for yourself and your child. This is something that psychotherapists do for their clients.

<blockquote>Stick with the philosophy.instead of soothing the tears, feeling with rather than dealing with. If you take a child's feelings seriously and sooth them when they need it, they will gradually learn to internalize that soothing and eventually become able to do it for themselves.</blockquote>

May need to practise yourself and deal with them. One way is by defining your feeling rather than yourself. Instead of "you are sad", say "you feel sad" or it "looks like you are feeling sad".

Don't dismiss feelings. One example is when kids say that monsters are under the bed. Instead of saying, "monsters don't exist", you can ask about what the names of the monster are. What they look like. Don't dismiss them.

#### Accepting Every Mood

It is not possible to be happy all the time. If you tell your children to be happy when they say they are "not happy". Scold them or argue that they should be happy or even give them advice, they will not be happy. They will grow to be confused and unsure of their own feelings. Also, you are not validating or connecting to them.

Asking why they feel like that is enquiring about them.
