[The Everything Store](The Everything Store)

Boldness, as someone in his 30s, I still need to be thinking about how I can make an impact and then raise the ambition by a few magnitudes from what I think is possible. The tendency to think small and achievable is something that people learn early in life, but you do need to adjust to be bigger.

Making Decisions quickly rather than get stuck in a planning or procrastination loop, something I am working on. Execute from start to finish with small scoping quickly.

Frugalness which is something I’ve got in spades.

Thoroughness, Bezos got very upset at an exec working on the initial S3 when asked how things would scale.

Setting a high standard. Bezos was not described as an easy person to work with in the book, but most people working there put up with it because he maintained a high standard.

6 page summaries, start with the customer first and describe the impact the end result for the product.

5 pizza teams. The author wasn’t sold on this outside of tech because of the amount of duplicated efforts that essentially do similar things i.e. legal, accounting, finance.

Using Walmart once a day logistics fails in terms of being able to adjust to random assortment of delivery packages. Used to think Walmart was really innovative after reading Sam Walton’s biography like Jeff Bezos, but they clearly didn’t keep pace. I’m sure some engineers at Walmart thought the internet would be massive but the company didn’t put their force into it.

Same with Amazon with their attempts at search and maps where they only put one team in charge of it. The guy who ran that was poached by Google. Luckily Jeff Bezos invested was an early investor into Google.

The book is in a few parts:

- Deciding to quit his job at DB Shaw and starting Amazon because of the internet wave
  - Teething problems with warehousing and ramping up new product categories
    - Most were accomplished by mathematical approach to packaging.
      - Jewerlry was not because of keystone pricing (double the wholesale cost or triple keystone pricing)
    - Which allowed them to start Prime and a super saver membership.
- Amazon as a Tech company
  - Starting AWS
  - The development of Kindle.
    - Using their might to force publishers to digitalise their books
    - Then forcing the price down to $9.99 when the cost is $15
    - Didn’t want Apple to get into books industry after they crushed the Music industry and Amazon’s attempts at an online music store.
- Amazon as a goliath
  - Competitors of Amazon are too late into the internet game. Target paid Amazon to put their wares on their site.
  - Toys R Us got destroyed by Amazon.
  - A knife company found that Amazon was selling their products under the Minimum Acceptable Price (MAP) forcing other distributors to lose profits so took their knives off Amazon but eventually got back in. Third party sellers were also selling on Amazon too.
  - Zappos and [Diapers.com](http://Diapers.com) were crushed by Amazon and were sold to them.
  - Some stuff about them being spending a lot of effort on avoid state taxes.
