- `Rhomboids`
- `Levator Scapulae`
- `Serratus Anterior`
- `Deltoid`
- `Pectoralis Minor`

## Movements

### Scapulo-humeral rhythm

This is the movement associated with lifting your arm up. The `scapula` and `humerus` move in a 1:2 ratio. The arm is lifted up 180 deg, where the scapula moves 60 deg and the humerus moves the 120 deg.
