![Neck muscles](./Prevertebral_neck_muscles.png)

These are the `cervical muscles` and are made up of the `Longus colli` and `Longus capitis`.

### Suboccipital Muscles

These are the muscles at the base of the head.

`Rectus Capitis Posterior Major and Minor` and `Obliquus Capitis Superior and Inferior`.

### Trapezius

[docs](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Trapezius)

These are large superficial muscles in from the back. They are made up of the descending (superior), ascending (inferior) and the middle.

It contributes to the `Scapulo-humeral rhythm` which is the lifting of the arm.

There are other muscles that it works with:

- `Rhomboids`
- `Levator Scapulae`
- `Serratus Anterior`
- `Deltoid`
- `Pectoralis Minor`
- `Latissimus Dorsi`
- `Suprastinatus`

### Rhomboids

[docs](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Rhomboids)

These are muscles that sit underneath the trapezius muscles. They are made up of two muscles the Rhomboid Major and Rhomboid Minor. Minor sits above (superior) to the Major.

### Vertebrae

## Movements

### Scapulo-humeral rhythm

This is the movement associated with lifting your arm up. The `scapula` and `humerus` move in a 1:2 ratio. The arm is lifted up 180 deg, where the scapula moves 60 deg and the humerus moves the 120 deg.
