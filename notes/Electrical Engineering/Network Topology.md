# Network Topology

# Dependencies
A network are made up of elements called  `branch`, `nodes` and `loops`. Branches are a single element, i.e. a voltage source or resistor.
A node is a point of connection between two branches and a loop is a closed path in a circuit.

The fundamental theorem of network topology.

$$
b = l + n - 1
$$

Elements are considered in `series` if they share the same node and carry the same element. They are considered in `parallel` if they are connected to the same two nodes.
