# Frontend Frameworks: CRUD

## Dependencies
The core ideas are componentisation of `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` code. You can bundle your code into either class or functional components so that they are modular and reuseable if needed. They have a `lifecycle`, things happen on first mount, on update and on removal. They also take in `props` and the output is the component HTML or whatever rendering template language. Typically, they will also have some internal `state` that can deal with `event handling`. 

### CRUD

## Dependents
- React
- Lit
- Vue
- Svelt
- Angular

## Interactions
Typically, you interact with them with a browser. You can examine component state in DevTools usually with a `web plugin`. 

You can also interact with them using a testing library like `Jest` or `Vitest` that can run those components.
