# Front End
Easily host the any front-end applications as static files on an S3 bucket. A BucketDeployment construct can be used to help you automate uploading your files.

Then a Cloudfront distribution can be used to serve your files.

If you want a custom URL, you may want to use Route53. https://dev.to/paulallies/deploy-your-static-react-app-to-aws-cloudfront-using-cdk-44hm
